Verification of fields.... can make validators

I'm not entirely sure what you have in mind by making these more generic, but you can make your own Mapping validators by composing already existing ones in the Forms object.

val nonEmptyAlphaText: Mapping[String] = nonEmptyText.verifying("Must contain letters and spaces only.", name => name.matches("[A-z\\s]+") )
And then you can use it in the Form:

val userForm = Form(
   "firstName" -> nonEmptyAlphaText
)
