Cannot connect as root after mysql upgrade (mariadb in this case)
For whatever reason, can connect to mysql root (as root account), but not from another user account

from solution in https://askubuntu.com/questions/766334/cant-login-as-mysql-user-root-from-normal-user-account-in-ubuntu-16-04

sudo mysql -u root
DROP USER 'root'@'localhost';
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

exit mysql and reconnect without sudo.
