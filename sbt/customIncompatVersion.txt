Scala libs  2.10.x are binary compatible with 2.10.0, but not with 2.9 or 2.8.
ScalaTest 2.1.2 : ScalaTest 2.0.x is source compat, but not bincompat. "However, 2.1.2 is binary compatible with 2.1.0 and 2.1.1"
Play 2.2 It appears that Play 2.2 is not compat with Play 2.0 in any way.
Not sure about Specs2, but I suspect 2.x and 2.0 are not binary compat.
Akka 2.3 It appears that Akka 2.3 is not compat with Akka 2.0 in any way.
